                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> "Medi App" is a web app for tracking medication.<br>
                    Users can login with their Google Account, add medication, track it with one click,
                    and track blood pressure.<br>
                    The project involved building the database with firebase, using the firebase commands
                    and building the client-side using React and Scss. <br>
                    - PWA<br>
                    - Hosted with Firebase<br>
                    <!-- On the technical side the requirement for the app was to use the MERN tech stack, be dynamic and single page, be responsive and has a pleasing and intuitive UI.-->

                        The problem to be solved was building the complete server-side and client-side for the
                        application from scratch.

                        The application was a private project for expanding my knowledge and keep practising.

                        The project brief described the features and the requirements accurately and the exercises were

                        To build an app that offer a way to track medication, there had to be the server-side, that
                        stores all the data, and the client-side, that has the user interface to
                        interact with all the information.

                    <p>
                        The first step was to create API requests using Firebase Services. For this, code with the
                        HTTP methods for the endpoints had to be written. <br>
                        After that the database was set up with Firebase. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Step: Create the Client Side</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the second part of building the app, I created the components with React.<br>
                        The main view component contained the app routing, and there had to be a registration and a
                        login components, handling the authentication.<br>
                        The main view displays ..., based on a function that maps through all ... and
                        creates ... components. <br>
                        <!-- Movie view, director and genre views get detailed information from the database and display
                        them. <br> -->
                        Functions to add and delete medication from a list were added. <br>
                        At this point the first part of the project, the server side, came together with the client
                        side - all connected and accessible through the UI.

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to understand the general structure of React and the use of props and state, how
                    things are connected, how data is passed between components and how it can be accessed in the
                    database to be used in the functions. <br>
                    I found it difficult to work with useEffect as I had an infinite loop updating the list from the
                    database.
                    With the help of an experienced developer I integrated useRef, after trying different cleanup
                    solution that failed.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Both parts of the application together, the server side and the client side, took me about 2
                        months.
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p>
                        The next step will be to refactor the code using Redux Thunk, structure code differently,
                        isolate the function. Also some work on the buttons in the profile view could be made.
