                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p> "Company Portfolio CMS" is a web app for creating websites.
                    <br>
                    Users can create pages for projects, update those projects, and upload images.
                    <br>
                    <!-- The project involved creating a RESTful API(?), building the database with ... and the client-side
                    using React... and Bootstrap/....
                    <br> -->
                    <!-- On the technical side the requirement for the app was to use the MERN tech stack, be dynamic and single page, be responsive and has a pleasing and intuitive UI.-->
                </p>

                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim of the project was build a web application using full-stack JavaScript technologies to
                        showcase for my portfolio. <br>
                        The problem to be solved was building the complete frontend and the admin environment from
                        scratch. I wanted to understand: how and where can I addtext and images and how can I get
                        the data and display it?
                        <br>
                        <!-- To achieve this, JavaScript development, web server frameworks, databases, business logic and
                        authentication had to be mastered using the MERN tech stack. -->

                    <p>
                        The application was part of my practise to build skills
                        in React, connecting to a database and implement the UI. <br>
                        A content management system is what I have been using
                        for my work so far so it was something I can relate to
                        and I was curious how it could be built.

                        To build an app that enables website creators to add information,
                        there had to be the server-side, that stores all the data,
                        and the client-side, that has the user interface to enable the user to
                        interact with all the information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Step: Create the Client Side</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the first part of building the app, I created the components with React.<br>
                        The main view component contained the app routing.<br>
                        The main view displays a dashboard with linked elements to the parts of the CMS and the actions
                        the user can take. <br>
                        <!-- Movie view, director and genre views get detailed information from the database and display
                        them. <br> -->
                        <!-- Functions to add and delete a movie from a list of favorites were added, as well as updating and
                        deleting user data. <br> -->
                        <!-- At this point the first part of the project, the server side, came together with the client
                        side - all connected and accessible through the UI. -->

                    <p>
                        The second step will be to create a database. For this I will use Firebase again as it has
                        built-in services that saves time and lets me concentrate more on the frontend.

                <p>
                    It was challenging to understand the general structure of React and the use of props and state, how
                    things are connected, how data is passed between components and how it can be accessed in the
                    database to be used in the functions. <br>
                    <!-- I found it difficult to find the right way to filter the favorite movies of a user and to implement
                    the authetication. <br> -->
                    <!-- To keep an orientation I got help from my mentor and a React developer I know. -->

                        Both parts of the application together, the server side and the client side, took me about 2
                        months.

                        isolate the function. Also some work on the buttons in the profile view could be made.
