                <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p> myMovies is a web app for movie fans, that offers information about movies, directors, and
                    genres.<br>
                    Users can create a profile, update their data, and collect their favorite movies.<br>
                    The project involved creating a RESTful API, building the databse with Mongo DB and the client-side
                    using React/Redux and Bootstrap.<br>
                    <!--                    On the technical side the requirement for the app was to use the MERN tech stack, be dynamic and single page, be responsive and has a pleasing and intuitive UI.-->

                    <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
                    <p>
                        The aim of the project was build a web application using full-stack JavaScript technologies to
                        showcase for my portfolio. <br>
                        The problem to be solved was building the complete server-side and client-side for the
                        application from scratch.
                        <br>
                        To achieve this, JavaScript development, web server frameworks, databases, business logic and
                        authentication had to be mastered using the MERN tech stack.

                    <h3>CONTEXT</h3>
                    <p>
                        The myMovies application was part of the web development course at CareerFoundry to build skills
                        in React and Redux, connecting to a self created API, build a database and implement Bootstrap
                        for the UI. <br>
                        The project brief described the features and the requirements accurately and the exercises were
                        structured to follow this guideline.

                <h2>APPROACH</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        To build an app that serves movie fans with information, there had to be the server-side, that
                        stores all the data, and the client-side, that has the user interface to enable movie fans to
                        interact with all the information.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. Step: Create the Server Side</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first step was to create a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. For this, code with the
                        HTTP methods for the endpoints had to be written, while looking at the user stories from the
                        project brief. <br>
                        After that the database was set up with Mongo DB. <br>
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="case-study-section">
                <div>
                    <h3>2. Step: Create the Client Side</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the second part of building the app, I created the components with React.<br>
                        The main view component contained the app routing, and there had to be a registration and a
                        login components, handling the authentication.<br>
                        The main view displays list of movies, based on a function that maps through all movies and
                        creates movie card components. <br>
                        Movie view, director and genre views get detailed information from the database and display
                        them. <br>
                        Functions to add and delete a movie from a list of favorites were added, as well as updating and
                        deleting user data. <br>
                        At this point the first part of the project, the server side, came together with the client
                        side - all connected and accessible through the UI.

                <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
                <p>
                    It was challenging to understand the general structure of React and the use of props and state, how
                    things are connected, how data is passed between components and how it can be accessed in the
                    database to be used in the functions. <br>
                    I found it difficult to find the right way to filter the favorite movies of a user and to implement
                    the authetication. <br>
                    To keep an orientation I got help from my mentor and a React developer I know.
                </p>

                <h3>DURATION + NEXT STEPS</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        Both parts of the application together, the server side and the client side, took me about 2
                        months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step will be to refactor the code using Redux Thunk, structure code differently,
                        isolate
                        the function. Also some work on the buttons in the profile view could be made.
                    </p>
                </div>
